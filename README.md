# Bioinformatics Scripts

This repository contains scripts for performing various bioinformatics analyses. 

## Current Scripts

### Protein Sequence Conservation Analysis

The program utilizes tools from the EMBOSS (European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite) suite, including Plotcon, Patmatmotifs, and Garnier, as well as the PhyML package. Given a user-defined subset of the taxonomic tree and a protein family name, the program determines the level of conservation in the protein sequences within the dataset using Plotcon.

Please refer to the help manual for usage instructions.
